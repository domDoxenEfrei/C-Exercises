/*
A binary tree is a data structure made up of successive elements (nodes), with each node represented by a structure containing a value (data) and two pointers, to two following nodes (generally called the 'left' and 'right' nodes of the current node). 

A tree starts from a root (which we'll simply call root in the following exercises) linked to all subsequent nodes. End nodes have their 'left' and 'right' nodes pointing to 'NULL' and are referred to as 'leaves'.

1. Create a 'Node'  structure corresponding to a node of a binary tree via typedef struct, containing 2 pointers left and right to the following 'Nodes' and an integer, called data.

2. Code a function int tree_count_nodes(Node* tree) taking as input the root of a binary tree and returning the number of nodes in the tree.
