/*
Do you know that a struct can contain another struct ? 

On your own machine : 

1. Make a Temperature struct with 

a float temperature member
a Point member (from previous exercise)
Create a function average_temperature(Temperature t1, Temperature t2) which computes the average of two temperatures struct

Do a unit test of it
