/*
We want to store a collection of data using key / value. To start we will do a naive approch using Linked lists. 

In order to do that we will use a struct named Entry with three members : 

char* key
float value
Entry* next
 
1. Create the struct Entry
2. In the test_main function, create a Linked List with two node. Specify the values  and the key of both nodes and connect node 1 to node 2.
