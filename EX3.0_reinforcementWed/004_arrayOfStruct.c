/*
We have the following struct Position { float x,y}
1. Create the struct using the typedef syntax
2. Code a function Position * average_position(Position* positions, int n_values) which takes an array of Point and returns a Point containing the average of all positions (both for x and y). 
3. Using test_main function to create an array of struct and check your function in a simple setting
