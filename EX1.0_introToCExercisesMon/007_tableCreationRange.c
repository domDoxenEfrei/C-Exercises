/*
Code a range function that creates an array and fills it with inters. 
The integer array must contain all integers between min_value (included) and max_value (excluded). 
The function must have the following prototype: 
int* range(int min_value, int max_value) 

Example: range(3, 7) returns the array [3, 4, 5, 6]
Note: No need for a main function!
