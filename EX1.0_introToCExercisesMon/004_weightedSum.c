/*
Create a function with the following prototype: 
float weighted_sum(float values[], float weights[], int n_values) 
which returns the weighted sum of values by weights

Example: 
if we take an array of values such as [1, 3, -1]
and take [0.5, 0, 1]
the function must calculate 0.5 * 1 + 0 * 3 + 1 * -1
