/*
Code a function Link* sll_reverse(Link* sll) taking as input the head of an LSC and returning the inverse of the list (tail becomes head and head becomes tail).

Attention: pointers must be inverted directly, and no new pointers must be created.

Examples:

sll_reverse( < 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 > ) => < 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 >
sll_reverse( < 5 → 12 → 42 → 55 → 42 > ) => < 42 → 55 → 42 → 12 → 5 >
sll_reverse( < > ) => < >
